Inspiration + Frame Decision
I've always wanted to make a cosplay with wings, as it's a common character trait.
However, the key is that these wings will be articulated. Thus, they'll have to move.

Initially, I wanted to decide whether the wings should have feathers or be like bat wings.
It seems that feathers are more common and the folding will be easier as its individual wings.

Moreover, this is the planning stage as I search for information.

The wings will have to fold.
The way they fold is what differs (point of movement).
From past cosplays, there are 2 main frame types.

For this project, I will be making wings that move at 1 joint, as that is simpler to build.
